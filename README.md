  <h1 align='center'>Asahi<br>Framework for web requests and more</h1>
</p>
This framework is aiming to be a modular, extensible and customizable crate.<br>
While having additional support for <code>hyper</code> HTTP client, reusable utility methods and more!<br><br>

> [!WARNING]
This framework/toolkit is currently work in progress as I find more reusable things to add and make it look framework-like, but it's currently in messy and janky state for now.<br>
Use at your own risk!
